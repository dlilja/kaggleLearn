# Kaggle Learn Notebooks

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks I created while doing the Kaggle
Learn courses and Zeppelin notebooks of translations from Python to Spark of
those notebooks. The notebooks assume that the data used is contained in a
folders called `data` in the working directory of the notebook. This repository
does not include any of the data used in the notebooks but each notebook details
where to collect the data.

Note that the notebooks are not self-contained in the sense that the formulation
of certain exercises are not included, only their solution.
